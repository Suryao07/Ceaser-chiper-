# 🔐 Ceaser-chiper- — Caesar Cipher in Python

**Ceaser-chiper-** is a simple Python project that demonstrates the working of the classical **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption technique. It allows users to encrypt plain text by shifting characters using a fixed key and decrypt the cipher text back to the original message.

This project is mainly created for learning cryptography basics, string manipulation, and algorithm implementation in Python.

## 📖 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the message is shifted forward by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Example with shift = 3:

```
A → D
B → E
C → F
HELLO → KHOOR
```

## 🚀 Features

* 🔒 Encrypts text using Caesar Cipher shift logic
* 🔓 Decrypts encrypted text back to original form
* ⚡ Fast execution
* 🐍 Implemented in Python
* 📚 Easy to understand and beginner friendly

## 🛠️ Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suryao07/Ceaser-chiper-.git
cd Ceaser-chiper-
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the program using:

```bash
python Ceaserchiper.py
```

Enter:

* The message you want to encrypt or decrypt
* The shift value (key)

The program will display the result instantly.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Takes input text from the user
2. Converts characters into their ASCII values
3. Shifts each character by the key value
4. Wraps around alphabets if the limit is crossed
5. Displays encrypted or decrypted output
